# Super Mario War Android Port
A fork of [Zander Kidd's Super Mario War Android Port](https://github.com/Zathki/supermariowar-android) with bug fixes and improvements.

## Changes
* Bug fixes ported from the main [Super Mario War Repository](https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar).
* Fixed the touch screen d-pad diagonals not working in the previous Android port.
* Cleaner button layout on the touch controls, larger jump button, and the Start/Select buttons have been moved over to the letterbox to give the game more uninterrupted screen space.
* Run button is now a toggle. Simply tap the button to start running, and tap again to stop.
* Files needed to easily open the project in Android Studio are now included.
* Data files needed are now included directly in the apk, no need for in game downloads.

## Building Instructions
* Open [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
* Select open project, select the project folder, and select open. (NOT the app folder, the folder that contains it!)
